"In the more traditional sense, a library is a collection of books. It can mean the collection, the building or room that houses such a collection, or both. The term 'library' has itself acquired a secondary meaning: 'a collection of useful material for common use.'" Biblioteka is Peter Behr's collection of web development libraries. It started accreting in November, 2010.



GENERAL

* In each language or resource category, a directory called "others" is used to store material from external sources.



CSS (Crerar)

* Single quotes are used in CSS whenever necessary, e.g. url('');.
* Resets don't define a default text color or background color.
* Measurements of 0 always have a contextually appropriate unit appended.



HTML (Regenstein)

* Double quotes are used in HTML.
* Comments begin after the <!DOCTYPE> declaration to prevent IE from going into quirks mode.



JS (Eckhart)

Conventions:

* Single quotes are used in JS.
* Semicolons, though optional, are always used.
* Anonymous functions are written with a space between the function keyword and empty argument parentheses.



SYSTEM (D'Angelo)

* Caveat usor!



TEXT (Harper)

* Double linebreaks separate paragraphs, triple linebreaks separate sections.



TYPE ()

* Empty at the moment, sadly.
